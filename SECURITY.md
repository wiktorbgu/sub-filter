## How to Report a Security Issue

If you think you’ve found a security problem in **sub-filter**, please let us know right away!  
Use the official reporting page:  
[https://github.com/viktor45/sub-filter/security/](https://github.com/Viktor45/sub-filter/security/)

We’ll work with you to check if it’s a real issue and fix it as quickly as possible.

When you report a problem, please include:

- **Which part** of the project is affected  
- **How to reproduce** the issue (step by step, if possible)  
- A short explanation of **what the problem is** and **why it could be dangerous**

👉 **Important:** Please don’t share the issue publicly right away.  
Instead, report it privately first. This gives us time to fix the problem and release an update—so all users stay protected before the details become public.

## Our Promise After a Report

If we confirm a security issue, here’s what we’ll do:

- We’ll fix the problem in:
  - The **latest release**
  - The **previous minor version** (so more people can stay protected)
- As soon as the fix is ready, we’ll release **new patched versions** for both

Thank you for helping keep **sub-filter** safe for everyone!
