# Contributing to sub-filter

Thanks for wanting to help improve **sub-filter**!  
Whether you’ve found a bug, fixed an issue, or have a cool idea—your help matters.  
Just follow these simple guidelines so everything stays organized and easy for everyone.

## 🐞 Found a Bug?

1. **Check if it’s already reported**  
   Look through the existing [Issues](https://github.com/viktor45/sub-filter/issues) to see if someone else has already reported the same problem.

2. **Report it if it’s new**  
   If you don’t see it listed, please [open a new bug report](https://github.com/viktor45/sub-filter/issues/new?template=🐞-bug-report.md).  
   To help us fix it fast, include:
   - A clear **title**
   - A simple **explanation** of what’s wrong
   - Steps to **reproduce the problem**
   - A small **code example** or **test case** showing what should happen vs. what actually happens

## 🛠️ Fixed a Bug?

Awesome! We really appreciate it.

- Create a **new Pull Request (PR)** with your fix.
- In your PR description:
  - Explain **what was broken** and **how you fixed it**
  - Mention the issue number if there’s one (like `Closes #42`)
- Keep your code clean and consistent with the rest of the project.

## 💡 Have a New Feature Idea or Want to Change Something?

Great ideas are welcome—but let’s talk first!

1. **Share your idea**  
   Open a [feature request](https://github.com/viktor45/sub-filter/issues/new?template=💡-feature-request.md) to describe what you’d like to add or improve.

2. **Wait for feedback**  
   Don’t start coding right away. Give the team and other users a chance to review your idea and give input.  
   We use GitHub Issues mostly for bugs and confirmed improvements, so **please get a thumbs-up before spending time on a big change**.

3. **Once approved—build it!**  
   Fork the repo, write your code, and send a clean, well-documented PR.
